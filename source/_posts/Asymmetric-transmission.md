<p>In this work, we theoretically investigate the propagation of terahertz (THz) waves through a graphene-loaded metal grating under external magnetic field. It is found that resonant modes in the system can be converted between transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polarizations due to Hall conductivity of graphene. As a consequence, asymmetric transmission of THz waves through this graphene-loaded metal grating is achieved. Furthermore, by adjusting either the external magnetic field or the Fermi level of graphene, such asymmetric wave propagation can be significantly tuned. The investigations may provide a unique way to achieve the graphene-loaded optodevices for THz waves.</p>
